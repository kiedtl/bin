Random scripts
=============

All scripts, unless otherwise noted at the top of each file, were written
by me. If I have stolen any scripts from others I've usually^W preserved the
headers and authorship information.

If you see one of your scripts here, and I forgot to give you credit, just
let me know with an issue or email and I'll fix it.

Special thanks to:

License
=======

- MIT License. Use these scripts however you please, but preserve the
  headers.
